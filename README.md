# Jean Pratt's Sliding Puzzle

The entire point of this project, insofar as I understand it, is to decode my way of thinking. To help guide you through my process, I've created this guide to list how I plan to approach the challenge. 

This guide will likely change, and all changes will be recorded in Git.

## First Goal: What logic is involved?

While I've played a 15-piece puzzle before, I've never actually created a game using a coding language. However, I do alredy have a pretty good idea of how I would design the game using SASS/CSS. Thus, the first, and likely most important, part of this process is dedicated to the logic of how this game will be put together.

**Task 1:** What does it need to do?

1. Have a 3 x 3 gameboard
2. Gameboard has one empty space
3. Tiles surrounding empty space will move there when clicked

Meanwhile, the board also needs to fit within the limitations
given by the assignment. 

- No markup changes are allowed within the body tag for index.html
- The application logic cannot be in the global scope
- No external front-end libraries / frameworks except where expressly permitted

From these specifics I can create an initial idea of how to create the game logic: *Use JavaScript to create a function that initializes when the class "sliding puzzle" is on a `<ul>` element.*

### Edits

There will likely be edits to the original game-logic idea. Edits, and when they were implemented, will be recorded here.

*No edits at this time.*
